# adac-rs

This workspace contains tooling for Arm Authenticated Debug an Access Control
(ADAC) specification. It provides the core library, command-line utilities,
cryptographic provider backends, and tests needed to create, sign, and
validate ADAC certificates and attestation tokens.

[Arm ADAC specifications (DEN0101)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0101/latest/) 
contain full normative definitions of ADAC data structures and processing rules.

## Workspace overview

- `adac`: Core library with ADAC data structures, certificate parsing, and signing/verification primitives.
- `adac-cli`: Command-line utility for creating, inspecting, and verifying ADAC artifacts.
- `adac-crypto-*`: Cryptographic provider backends (RustCrypto, AWS-LC, PKCS#11, Cryptoki) that plug into the core library.
- `adac-tests`: Integration and conformance harnesses. See `adac-tests/README.md` for the full matrix and environment setup.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain (install via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/)); the workspace tracks the latest stable release, so `rustup update` beforehand is recommended.
- `cargo` (bundled with rustup) for building and running binaries.
- Optional: `SoftHSM2` or another PKCS#11 provider if you plan to exercise the PKCS#11 backends.

## Build and run `adac-cli`

```bash
# Build the CLI (release builds live in target/release)
cargo build -p adac-cli

# Run the CLI; pass --help to see the available subcommands
cargo run -p adac-cli -- --help

# Install the CLI into ~/.cargo/bin
cargo install --path adac-cli
```

Most CLI subcommands operate on ADAC certificates or tokens. Add the
appropriate flags (for example `display`, `sign`, `verify`) as documented
by the `--help` output.

## Testing

```bash
# Run the default workspace test suite
cargo test

# Focus on a single crate (example: the CLI)
cargo test -p adac-cli
```

Advanced and cross-environment validation lives in `adac-tests`. Refer to
[adac-tests/README.md](adac-tests/README.md) for setup instructions
(SoftHSM2, hardware tokens) and the commands needed to execute the broader
matrix.

- (1): Only verification works. There is an issue with the 
  [p521](https://crates.io/crates/p521) crate for signature.
- (2): Implementation untested, `SoftHSM2` does not support `phFlag=1` option for EdDSA signature or verification.

Legend: :white_check_mark: implemented and tested, :construction: planned or
partially implemented, :x: not currently available.
